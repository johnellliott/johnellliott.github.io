            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<h4>What is the point of this site?</h4>
<p>
The goal of this site is to help make sense of the world. By thinking of cities in comparison to other cities, you can better understand exotic places you have barely heard of. This is thanks to the fundamental and intrinsic nature of using analogies as a tool for understanding. According to <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=RrRtEAP3W6QC&lpg=PP4&ots=l0pu6tVx_h&dq=The%20Subtlety%20of%20Sameness%3A%20A%20Theory%20and%20Computer%20Model%20of%20Analogy%20Making&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false" target="_blank">Robert M. French</a>:

<p>
If you're from the United States, you probably have a good sense of San Diego's famously perfect climate, but may not know that cities on the north-west of Morocco have very similar climates. Or if you're from Europe, you may have a good grasp of the economy of London, but may not fully understand how it compares with booming Asian megacities.
</p>
</p>
This site lets you select a city, then explore how it compares with other global cities in an interactive map. By changing the sliders in the left hand side, you can choose whether you want to compare cities by their culture, economy or climate, or choose how to combine them into a single score. 
</p>
<h4>
What are the Culture, Economy and Weather sliders for?
</h4>
<p>
These controls, located on the left-side of the screen, allow you to decide how much of culture, economy or weather should affect the match scores between cities. For example, you can match on weather alone by moving that slider to its maximum value (100). The sliders default to an even 33.3 split between culture, economy and weather. The sliders automatically balance as you move them, so you may need to use the check-boxes to lock one slider before changing another slider.
</p>

<h4>
Why is City X matched with City Y?
</h4>
<p>
There are a huge number of variables that go into the match calculations, over 1,000 cities, and over 1.5 million pair-matches, so answers to all specific matches are not feasible.
</p>
<p>
If you want to understand the reasons for a match, you can read this FAQ and read the <a href="blog/index.html">site blog</a> for details on how matches are calculated. Alternatively, have a look at their Wikipedia page for similar characteristics. Finally, you can adjust the three sliders of Culture, Economy and Weather and have a look at the bar chart on the left-hand side of the site to better understand what matches between two cities.
</p>
<h4>
How are matches calculated? 
</h4>
<p>
Matches are calculated using predictive mathematical models. Weather, culture and economic matches are calculated independently to allow you to choose how to blend them using the sliders on the left-hand side of the site. 
</p>
<!--
<p>
More details on the inputs and calculations can be found here. 
</p>
-->
<h4>
What factors affect economic matches? 
</h4>
<p>
GDP per capita, economic size, <a href="http://www.transparency.org/cpi2014" target="_blank">levels of corruption</a> and types of industry affect economic matches. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/rb/rb5.html" target="_blank">GaWC study</a> of global cities also impacts the economic match results. 
</p>
<h4>
How do you determine industry types for a city? 
</h4>
<p>
This data is based on a number of sources. For example, a 'port' metric included and is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world%27s_busiest_container_ports" target="_blank">TEU figures</a> and the size of the finance industry is estimated based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Financial_Centres_Index" target="_blank">Global Financial Centres Index</a>. Other industry characteristics are determined based on analysis of Wikipedia word counts. This form of social media analysis is inspired by the research undertaken by <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=SgBtHYMWQp8C&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false" target="_blank">Tawan Banchuen</a> for characterising cities.
</p>
<h4>
What factors affect cultural matches?
</h4>
<p>
Some of the key metrics are <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=o4OqTgV3V00C&redir_esc=y" target="_blank">Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer_Quality_of_Living_Survey" target="_blank">Mercer Quality of Living Survey</a>, demographic data, climate, the size of the population and characteristics of the cityscape (again, based on analysis of Wikipedia word counts) affect cultural matches. 
</p>
<h4>
What factors affect weather matches? 
</h4>
<p>
Long term climate data is primarily used here. In particular summer and winter temperature averages and rainfall patterns and totals. <a href="glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Continentality" target="_blank">Conrad's coefficient of continentality</a> and elevation are also used.
</p>
<h4>
Are all of the matching algorithms equally accurate?
</h4>
<p>
No. The weather-matching algorithm is the most accurate. Its input data is long-term environmental observations and its target variable is the most conceptually concrete. The economic and cultural input data is less reliable, less complete, more subjective and the target variable is also more abstract for those two models.
</p>
<h4>
Why are small settlements included in the map? 
</h4>
<p>
Small settlements and research stations are included to increase geographic coverage of and have a wider range of climates. Many of these are located in inhospitable regions such as the polar regions or the Sahara desert. 
</p>
<h4>
What population measurement is used for cities? 
</h4>
<p>
'Urban area' is a more important variable but the 'city proper' is also incorporated in the model. Urban area is used as I consider it to be more representative than arbitrary political boundaries. For example, it makes more sense, on a global scale, to consider Manila to be a city populated with 20m+ than using the 1.5m population of its official city boundaries. 
</p>
<p>
The urban area figures used are not discrete and can overlap for some cities. For example, urban area population figures for Tokyo and Yokohama overlap and are double-counted as, for the purposes of this site, it makes sense to consider both of them as being part of a mega city.
</p>
<h4>
How many cities and matches are included? 
</h4>
<p>
There are over 1000 cities in this data set. These require more than 1.5 million city-to-city match scores, each of which involves around 100 calculations, meaning the data set on which the site is built requires at least 150 million calculations. 
</p>
<p>
To put this in some context, producing the final data set takes over two hours of continuous processing on a computer with an Intel Core i7 processor with an SSD and 8GB RAM.
